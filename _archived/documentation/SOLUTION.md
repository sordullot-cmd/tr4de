## 🎯 Quick Checklist

Before import, ensure:

- [ ] File is saved as `.csv` (not .xlsx)
- [ ] First row has column names (Date, B/S, Contract, etc.)
- [ ] Data rows start from row 2
- [ ] B/S column contains BUY or SELL
- [ ] avgPrice column has numbers
- [ ] PnL column has numbers (can be negative)

---

## ❓ If Import Still Shows "No Trades"

**Step 1:** Verify file format
```bash
node test-advanced.js
```
- If this works, your CSV is good
- If not, file needs formatting

**Step 2:** Check column names
Open your CSV in Notepad and look at:
- First row (headers)
- Must contain: Date, B/S, Contract, avgPrice, PnL

**Step 3:** Try sample file first
```
sample_trades_format2.csv works? → Your setup is OK
sample_trades_format2.csv fails? → Restart server
```

**Step 4:** Refresh browser
```
Press: Ctrl + R (Windows)
or: Cmd + R (Mac)
```

---

## 📞 If Still Not Working

### Debug Step 1: Check Headers
```bash
# Open your CSV in Notepad
# Look at the first line
# It should look like:
# Date,Account,OrderID,B/S,Contract,avgPrice,PnL

# If it doesn't have these column names, 
# you need to rename them in Excel first
```

### Debug Step 2: Check Data
```bash
# Look at line 2 (first trade)
# Should look like:
# 2026-03-31,46008134031,30728,BUY,NASDAQ 100,19842.75,312

# If different, verify:
# - Date is YYYY-MM-DD format (or any date format)
# - B/S is BUY or SELL (not Buy/Sell mixed)
# - avgPrice is a number (19842.75, not $19,842.75)
# - PnL is a number (312, not $312.00)
```

### Debug Step 3: Test Setup
```bash
# 1. Are servers running?
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# 2. Is frontend accessible?
http://localhost:3000

# 3. Test parser:
node test-advanced.js
```
